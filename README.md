# An International Common Mechanism for DNA Synthesis Screening

## To do 
Search acceleration:
* Data structures based on k-mers for querying large collections of sequencing datasets: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/866756v3
* Look into COBS indexing: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.02.433662v1; https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09624
  * We have collaborators who could help with this approach
* Look into sketching and containment - mash screen https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1841-x
* Look into ntHash: https://github.com/bcgsc/ntHash
