		     Gene: PE2 [Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]
 STEP 1 completed at 2024-06-24 23:10:58
 >> STEP 2: Checking regulated pathogen proteins...
		 --> Best match to sequence(s) KXB23588 at bases 7507 - 7607 found in only regulated organisms: FLAG (bacteria)
		     Species: Legionella pneumophila (taxid(s): 446) (73.469 percent identity to query)
		     Description: hypothetical protein PtVF66_13895, partial [Legionella pneumophila]
		 --> Best match to sequence(s) WP_099588326 at bases 6123 - 6929 found in both regulated and non-regulated organisms
		     Species: Bacillus cereus group sp. BY9-3LC, Clostridioides difficile, Streptococcus dysgalactiae,

 STEP 2 completed at 2024-06-24 23:23:21
 >> STEP 3: Checking regulated pathogen nucleotides...
	...protein hits found, fetching nt regions not covered by a 90% ID hit or better
		 --> no top hit exclusive to a regulated pathogen: PASS
 STEP 3 completed at 2024-06-24 23:23:32
>> STEP 4: Checking any pathogen regions for benign components...
	...no housekeeping protein hits
	...no benign RNA hits
		 -->Synbio sequences - <80% coverage achieved = FAIL
		 -->Regulated region at bases 7507 to 7607 failed to clear: FLAG
